# VMs-For-Web-App

This is a project completed as part of a Udemy Course on DevOps. The goal was to set up a multi-tier web application using Virtual Machines.

<!-- The web application is a fake pre-coded social media site developed in Java (source code copied from: https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project) -->

The services set up on the Virtual Machines were:

- Nginx for the load balancer
- Apache Tomcat for the server with NFS storage
- Rabbit MQ as a queueing agent (not functional in this web application, but was included for extra practice)
- MemCached service for database caching
- MySQL for database
